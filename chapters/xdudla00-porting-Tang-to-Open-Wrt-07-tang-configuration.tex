\chapter{Tang on OpenWrt}\label{config}

Having the installation capable packages in our buildroot is only the half of the work done.
We need to install them on the actual device and setup the enviroment especially for the Tang package to work correctly.
The installation of the packages on OpenWrt is done with the opkg package manager.

The opkg (Open Package Management System) is a lightweight package manager used to download and install OpenWrt packages.
These packages could be stored somewhere on device's filesystem or the package manager will download them from local package repositories or ones located on the Internet mirrors.
Users already familiar with GNU/Linux package managers like dnf, yum, apt/apt-get, pacman, emerge etc. will definitely recognize the similarities.
It also has similarities with NSLU2's Optware, also made for embedded devices.

Opkg attempts to resolve dependencies with packages in the available repositories/mirrors.
If the opkg fails to find the dependency, it will report an error, and abort the installation of selected package.

Missing dependencies with third-party packages are probably available from the source of the package.

Remember that we removed systemd related lines from sources.
Now we do not have automatic updates of the Tang's cache and keys are not generated when tang has empty database.



\section{Install the packages}

The packages that have been built in our buildroot are not available in any online mirror yet.
To make it available for openwrt we should create a pull-request and hope for the comunity to accept it.
Before we do so, we have to make sure, that the built packages are working with installing them and testing their functionality.

To get our newly built packages to the target device running the OpenWrt we can upload them using scp to device's filesystem.
After successfull build the packages are present in the bin/packages/mips\_24kc/packages/ directory:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
scp bin/packages/mips_24kc/packages/*.ipk root@192.168.0.1:/root/custom-packages/
\end{lstlisting}
This command will upload every package built before in builroot to the device's /root/custom-packages/ directory.
The buildroot should contain at least these files:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
$ ls bin/packages/mips_24kc/packages/
bash_4.4.12-1_mips_24kc.ipk
jansson_2.10-1_mips_24kc.ipk
jose_10-1_mips_24kc.ipk
libhttp-parser_2.8.0-1_mips_24kc.ipk
libjose_10-1_mips_24kc.ipk
Packages
Packages.gz
Packages.manifest
Packages.sig
tang_6-1_mips_24kc.ipk
xinetd_2.3.15-5_mips_24kc.ipk
\end{lstlisting}
After the successfull upload connect to the device and install packages.
We recommend installing only newly built or updated packages.
opkg will resolve known dependencies from the mirrors and will install them.
Make sure that you install them in right order.
Due to fact that opkg not is not capable to resolve these new packages.
Install the packages using opkg:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
opkg install /root/custom-packages/jansson_2.10-1_mips_24kc.ipk
opkg install /root/custom-packages/jose_10-1_mips_24kc.ipk
opkg install /root/custom-packages/libhttp-parser_2.8.0-1_mips_24kc.ipk
opkg install /root/custom-packages/tang_6-1_mips_24kc.ipk
\end{lstlisting}
The opkg tool will resolve other dependencies and install them as well.
After packages are installed we may now proceed to the enviroment setup.



\section{Setting up the Tang keys}
The Tang server is packaged with the cripts which help us to genarate keys and cache for the Tang daemon.
Only problem with them was that OpenWrt has no realpath available therefore the {\tt tangd-update} script did not work on OpenWrt.
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
bash: realpath: command not found
\end{lstlisting}
Simply replacing it with {\tt readlink -f} solved an issue and script with such change is capable of generating cache.
Creating a diff file for this change and adding it into {\it utils/tang/patches} should be in order.

The OpenWrt Makefile can define section "Package/\$(PKG\_NAME)/postinst".
This section usually contain a short shell script to tweak the package after installation to make package work out of the box.
We can reflect behavior described above to this short sript and add it to the Tang's Makefile:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
define Package/tang/postinst
#!/bin/sh
if [ -z "$${IPKG_INSTROOT}" ]; then
	mkdir -p /usr/share/tang/db && mkdir -p /usr/share/tang/cache
	KEYS=$(find /usr/share/tang/db/ -name "*.jw*" -maxdepth 1 | wc -l)
	if [ "${KEYS}" = "0" ]; then # if db is empty generate new key pair
		/usr/libexec/tangd-keygen /usr/share/tang/db/
	elif [ "${KEYS}" = "1" ]; then # having 1 key should not happen
		(>&2 echo "Please check the Tang's keys in /usr/share/tang/db \
and regenate cache using /usr/libexec/tangd-update script.")
	else
		/usr/libexec/tangd-update /usr/share/tang/db/ /usr/share/tang/cache/
	fi
	(cat /etc/services | grep -E "tangd.*8888\/tcp") > /dev/null \
		|| echo -e "tangd\t\t8888/tcp" >> /etc/services
fi
endef
\end{lstlisting}



\section{Configure Tang for xinetd}

We need xinetd's socket activation for Tang to work.
And to do so we will need a configuration file for the tangd service for xinetd daemon:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10},caption=Configuration of Tang service for xinetd]
service tangd
{
    port            = 8888
    socket_type     = stream
    wait            = no
    user            = root
    server          = /usr/libexec/tangd
    server_args     = /usr/share/tang/cache
    log_on_success  += USERID
    log_on_failure  += USERID
    disable         = no
}
\end{lstlisting}
This is configuration to run /usr/libexec/tangd anfter a request comes to port 8888.
The server will be spawned with one argument, the cache directory.
Please note that we used other directory compared to Fedora.
We need to have Tang keys stored on persistent data storage.
The /var/ location is only a symling to the /tmp directory on OpenWrt device.
The developers on IRC channel proposed to use the persistent /usr/share/ directory for that purpose.

The last step before starting the Tang service on OpenWrt would be to setup /etc/services:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
# echo -e "tangd\t\t8888/tcp" >> /etc/services
\end{lstlisting}
In such case of the accidental removal of this file we have to copy the backup of the file from devices ROM and edit it again.
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
# cp /rom/etc/services /etc/services
\end{lstlisting}
Now we shall restart the xinetd daemon using the xinetd script located in /etc/init.d/ directory of the device:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
#/etc/init.d/xinetd stop
#/etc/init.d/xinetd start
\end{lstlisting}

To test that service is running we can use the telnet to the device on port defined in the xinetd configuration.
The server should advertise its public key.
It can be retrieved with simple GET request for /adv contenr from the server.
Try telnet to device write "GET /adv HTTP/1.1" and confirm this with two newlines.
The ouput similar to following should appear:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
$ telnet 192.168.0.1 8888
Trying 192.168.0.1...
Connected to 192.168.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /adv HTTP/1.1

<unknown> GET /adv => 200 (src/tangd.c:85)
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

\end{lstlisting}
The content of the first line from server response should be suspicious to us.
According to the RFC 2616 the HTTP header should not contain such line\cite{RFC2616}.
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
<unknown> GET /adv => 200 (src/tangd.c:85)
\end{lstlisting}
After some investigation done in the Tang sources we found out that the line contain some debug information from the Tang daemon which were written to the /dev/stderr.
From this we can assume that xinetd is sending also /dev/stderr to the created socker.
To bypass this beavior we should write som wrapper script which will redirect the /dev/stderr ouptut somewhere else.
We decided that this output may be helpful for debugging purpose and forwarded it to the some sort of log file in the /var/log/ directory of the device using this script:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
#!/bin/bash
echo "==================================" >> /var/log/tangd.log
echo `date`: >> /var/log/tangd.log
/usr/libexec/tangd $1 2>> /var/log/tangd.log
\end{lstlisting}
Let us name this wrapper script the tangdw.

To get Tang to work we need to put invocation of this script in place where tangd binary was configured to.
Move the script to the /usr/libexec directory where the tangd binary is to have it in one place and edit the line of xinetd configuration to run wrapper:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
    server          = /usr/libexec/tangdw
\end{lstlisting}
The last thing would be to change the sript's permissions on device to allow execution.

We did a lot changes to the configuration.
The Tang for the OpenWrt platform needs a xinetd configuration which for the ease of use could be packaged with it.
The same with the wrapper script in order to have the service working correctly we also need this file.
There is a way to add new files for each package and package them for the OpenWrt's opkg to install.
To do so we will crate a directory for the files in the package's feeds repository we forked on branch containing commit adding the Tang and copy files there.
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
$ cd packages-OpenWrt
$ git checkout add-tang
$ mkdir -p utils/tang/files
\end{lstlisting}
As the new files are copied there we need to also edit a {\it Package/tang/install} section to install these files in proper directories (config file into dedicated /etc/xinetd.d/; wrapper into /usr/libexec/) as shown:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,tabsize=4,backgroundcolor=\color{yellow!10}]
define Package/tang/install
	$(INSTALL_DIR)	$(1)/usr/libexec
	$(INSTALL_DIR)	$(1)/etc/xinetd.d/
	$(INSTALL_BIN)	\
			$(PKG_INSTALL_DIR)/usr/libexec/$(PKG_NAME)d*	$(1)/usr/libexec/
	$(INSTALL_BIN)	./files/tangdw	$(1)/usr/libexec/
	$(CP)			./files/tangdx	$(1)/etc/xinetd.d/
endef
\end{lstlisting}
After all changes done last thing would be to ammend commit on a branch, update the feeds in buildroot, rebuild the Tang package, upload and reinstall it on our device running the OpenWrt.
Due to many changes to the Makefile and the Tang branch in packages see the submitted pull-request\footnote{https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/5447} where all changes are.


\section{Contribute you work!}

Note that every update and new package we did has its reference to an upstream pull-request.
Have in mind that everyone can profit from our work.
Do not be afraid to contribute to upstream.
It is not always easy but following contribution guide for specific project is a big help.
The result or even journey of the upstream contribution will definitelly get us some experience.
Be tidy and pedantic, try to write easy to understand commits and files/pathches that have purpose and are well formated.
It is the best way to have comunity on your side!




\section{Tang's limitations}\label{limitations}

Let us sum up the limitations that Tang has on OpenWrt platform due to replaced systemd dependency with less capable xinetd implementation of super-server.
We also found one platform independent limitation of the Tang's solution to full disk description on early boot.

\paragraph{Key exchange and generation} of cache must be manual but  can be automated with inotifytools to watch directory for change and run update script automatically.
But this mean that the embeded device with such configuration will have another proccess always running.
We decided to not implement automated update of the cachce in favor to computation resources being available to other services.

\paragraph{xinetd forwarding the stderr} output to the socket as well is a little problem.
To have tang working correctly we wrote a wrapper running the shell script redirecting the stderr into log file.
Running some shell script takes some time compared to only running the binary file but for xinetd it is neccessary.

\paragraph{Early boot decryption using Wi-Fi network} is a platform independent chicken-egg problem caused by information about wireless network being encrypted on system volume.
The information needed to connect to wireless network needs to be decrypted but in order to decrypt them automatically we need to connect to network exposed to Tang server.
It could be solved using a TPM to store information about such network but it is a security vulnerability and must be considered with a caution.
