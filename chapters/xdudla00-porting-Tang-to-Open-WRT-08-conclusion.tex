\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conlusion}

The Tang \ref{tang} server is a very lightweight program.
It provides secure and anonymous data binding using McCallum-Relyea exchange \ref{mrexchange} algorythm.

Clevis \ref{clevis} is a client software with full support for Tang.
It has minimal dependencies and it is possible to use with HTTP, Escrow \ref{escrow}, and it implements Shamir Secret Sharing.
Clevis has GNOME integration so it is not only a command line tool.
Clevis also supports early boot integration with dracut or even removable devices unocking using UDisks2.

To port Tang to OpenWrt system it will be necesarry to port all its dependencies first.
The OpenWrt system has already package openssl, zlib, and jansson but only version 2.7 which is too old.
So there will be a need for porting jansson. Jos√© will require porting and http-parser too.
The systemd would be huge effort but tang's requirements are minimal and we should be able to
work with xinetd. Finally, some work will be required to port Tang itself.
