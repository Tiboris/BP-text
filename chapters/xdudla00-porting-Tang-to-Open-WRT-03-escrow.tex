\chapter{Escrow}\label{escrow}
Before Tang, automated decryption was handled usually with key escrow.
Client using key escrow usually generates a key, encrypt data with it and then stores the key in a remote server.
Key escrow server (also known as a “fair” cryptosystem) stores decryption keys. This should signal potential security risks when storing and also transmitting keys over network.
For security purposes key escrow uses SSL/TLS to provide privacy and data integrity between server and client.
Even with SSL/TLS key escrow requires authentication.
\todo{Treba to doplnit...}
To sum up an authorized third party may gain access to those keys under certain circumstances only.
