        abstract={The SANS Institute indicates that weak or nonexistent passwords are among the top 10 most critical computer vulnerabilities in homes and businesses. A compromised password is an opportunity for someone to explore files and accounts, and even obtain administrative privileges, undetected. Security experts at the SANS Institute predict major liability lawsuits for companies whose computer systems exhibit security lapses. Security breaches not only put firms at risk of litigation for failing to protect confidential information, they can also lead to financial losses. Passwords are commonly used to gain access to websites storing confidential financial information. The most common password vulnerabilities include user and administrative accounts with weak or nonexistent passwords and the lack of company policy to adequately protect passwords. Effective measures to reduce network vulnerability and increase security include the implementation of policies that outline important password habits, and proactive verification of password integrity.},
